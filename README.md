# Customer Segmentation Leveraging K-Means Clustering
Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm, find the value for K using the Elbow method, the Silhouette method, and the Gap statistic, and visualize the clusters with Principal Components Analysis (PCA). This uses real data containing information on marketing newsletters and email campaigns, as well as transaction-level data from customers.
The case study is based on [this blog post](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/customer-segmentation-using-python.html) by the `yhat` blog.
